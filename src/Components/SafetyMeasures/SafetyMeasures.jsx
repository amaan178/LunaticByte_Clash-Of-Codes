        <h3>Be wary of public Wi-Fi</h3>
        <p>Don’t let the convenience of Internet access cloud your judgment. When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers looking to steal valuable information can access your data including credit card or Social Security numbers. If you do need wireless Internet service, set up a virtual private network (VPN) that will allow you to access the Internet securely while traveling.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="c-services__item">
        <h3> Keep your friends and family updated</h3>
        <p>No matter whether you’re going, on an overnight jaunt or a month-long international journey, it’s always a good idea to let friends or family back home know. Before you leave, send a copy of your itinerary to a few trusted people who can keep tabs on your whereabouts. Check in regularly with your contacts so they know you’re where you’re supposed to be.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="c-services__item">
        <h3>Research ground transportation</h3>
        <p> Research taxi and ridesharing companies that are available and reputable in the area. Do they take credit cards or only cash? Is there a number you can call if you have a bad experience? If you plan on taking public transportation, look for a mobile app that has real-time updates for the transportation system at your destination. This can help you avoid waiting for a bus in an isolated area.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="c-services__item">
        <h3>Familiarize yourself with the destination</h3>
        <p>Use tools like Google Maps to scout out the area around your destination. Is there a hospital or police station located near where you’re staying? Check to see if there are local bus stops in the area or a shopping center where you can easily find a cab. If you plan on going out in the evenings, plan your return trip in advance.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="c-services__item">
        <h3>Beware of “Vacation Brain.”</h3>
        <p>It’s nice to relax and put your worries on pause, but that doesn’t mean you should let your guard down. Many vacation destinations can create a false sense of security. You may become fast friends with the people you meet, but give them time to earn your trust.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="c-services__item">
        <h3>Keep track of what you drink.</h3>
        <p>Be smart about what drink. Not familiar with an ingredient? Look it up on your smartphone. Keep track of how much you’ve had to drink, and be aware of danger signs. If something doesn’t seem right for example, if you feel more intoxicated than you should or if a situation is making you uncomfortable, get to a safe place as soon as you can. Learn more about steps you can take to stay safe if you want to drink.</p>
